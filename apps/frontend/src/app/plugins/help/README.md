# Help

Removal of this plugin will result in an application without the "_Unlock Full Product Access_" popup and watermark in the corner.

## Plugins in Workflow Builder

The application can run without this folder by using stub files.

If you want to remove references to the stubs, you can also delete the line where it was imported from: `apps/frontend/src/app/features/plugins-core/index.ts`
