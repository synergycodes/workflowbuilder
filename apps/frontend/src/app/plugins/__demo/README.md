# Demo

**Workflow Builder** includes plugins that can often be used independently but are not typically used together. For example, the "_Avoid Nodes Edges_" plugin (which automatically finds the best path for an edge between two nodes) and the "_Reshapable edges_" plugin (which allows manual manipulation of edges) are usually not combined.

The role of this plugin is to add additional options that allow switching between different modes.
